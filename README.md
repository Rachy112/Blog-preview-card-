### What I learned

I was able to learned more about CSS styling which has been mmaking me better in CSS coding. 
Below are the code samples that are of great reinforcement to my knowledge.

```html
<h2>HTML code I'm proud of</h2>
<img>HTML code I'm proud of<img>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  test-shadow: 0px 0px 0px black;
}
```

### Continued development

It will be a great pleasure to focus more on test-shadow so i can learn more on how use it on my project without having issue. I will also like to focus on CSS to learn more about styling of project.
